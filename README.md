# upgrade-0.70-to-.78

I am a beginner and I have a React Native project that I want to upgrade. The current version is 0.70.0, and I want to upgrade it to 0.78.0. However, when I try to install the dependencies and packages of the old project, the peer dependencies don't match. It keeps requesting version changes, which I have tried, but without success.
